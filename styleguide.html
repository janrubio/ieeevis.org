  <h2>Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Criteria</h2>
  <p>As the leading academic event on visualization research, <em>IEEE VIS</em> expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative contributions. Submissions will be judged on their importance, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. Papers and any supplemental material are only conditionally accepted and will undergo a full revision and review cycle after initial notification of review results. During this time, reviewers will ensure that necessary conditions for acceptance have been met in the new revision.</p>

  <p>Additionally, <em>IEEE VIS 2019</em> will feature a separate, short papers track with a submission deadline of <em><strong>June 13, 2019</strong></em>, after notifications for full papers have been sent out. You can find out more in the call for participation for <a href="">IEEE VIS Short Papers</a>.</p>

  <p>When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the <a href="">paper submission guidelines</a>.</p>

  <p>The three conference tracks at <em>IEEE VIS 2019</em> use the same submission and review process. The conferences differ in the topics, emphasis, and approach, as described in the conference-specific for <a href="">VAST</a>, <a href="">InfoVis</a>, and <a href="">SciVis</a>.</p>

  <p>Authors of accepted papers should also follow the <a href="">instructions for preparing a camera-ready submission</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Which conference track should I submit to?</strong></p>
      <p>We encourage you to allocate your submission to one of the three tracks above. But if you are unsure, you will have the option to allow the paper chairs to allocate your paper to the one they deem the most appropriate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Where will papers appear?</strong></p>
        <p>Full papers accepted to IEEE InfoVis, SciVis, and most of VAST will appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Some papers of the VAST conference will be published as archival, conference publications.</p>

      <h3>Welcome to IEEE VIS 2019 in Vancouver!</h3>
      <p>VIS 2019 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools.</p>
      <p>We invite you to share your research, insights, and enthusiasm at IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis), and IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis). The 2019 program will also feature a diverse range of symposia and co-located events, including Visualization in Practice, Visualization in Data Science, the VIS Arts Program, and data analysis Challenge competitions, as well as a new Application Spotlights track.</p>
      <p>For 2019, IEEE VIS will take place in Vancouver, one of Canada’s most iconic tech cities. Part of the Cascadia Innovation Corridor and home to the Canadian IT Supercluster, Vancouver is also renowned for its scenic beauty, outdoor activities, and vibrant west-coast culture.</p>
